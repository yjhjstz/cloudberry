ABOUT GP DEMO
******************************************************************

The GP demo program will setup a virtual Cloudberry Database system
on a single host. It creates and starts a GP coordinator instance and
three segment instances (three primary and three mirror segments)
within the same directory. Running GP demo is a good way to test
your initial installation before deploying the Cloudberry Database
software on a multi-host array. It is also a good way to become
familiar with the system without investing the time involved in a
multi-host setup.

******************************************************************
BEFORE YOU BEGIN
******************************************************************

Before running GP demo, you must at least have 700 MB of free disk
space, and have the TCP ports defined in gpAux/gpdemo/Makefile free.

* Verify that your $USER environment variable is set. 

* Cloudberry Database recommends using the bash shell to run the
  GP demo programs.

******************************************************************
RUNNING GP DEMO
******************************************************************

1. Login as the Cloudberry designated user (i.e. 'gpadmin').

	su - gpadmin

2. Source greenplum_path.sh

	. /usr/local/gpdb/greenplum_path.sh

   Note: There is a space between the dot and the slash.

   The "." will source the greenplum_path.sh into the current
   shell, instead of starting a subprocess.

3. Create the cluster at the current directory:

   gpdemo

   By default, all data of the demo cluster will be stored in
   "./datadirs" of the current directory. You may change this by
   cd to another directory or using "DATADIRS" environment variable
   described in the next section.

4. Source ./gpdemo-env.sh

5. If setup completes correctly, you will have a virtual Cloudberry
   Database system running on the local host. You can connect to it
   using the psql client program as follows:

	psql postgres

6. To exit the psql client program:

	\q

7. See the Cloudberry Database User Guide for more information on
   using your Cloudberry Database system.


******************************************************************
REMOVING GP DEMO
******************************************************************

1. In the directory where you run "gpdemo" to create cluster:

	gpdemo -d

2. This will stop all Cloudberry Database demo server processes
   and remove all files and directories created by the GP demo
   program.


******************************************************************
MODIFYING GP DEMO SETTINGS
******************************************************************

Certain parameters of the demo cluster are adjustable by setting
environment variables before initializing the cluster:

* Coordinator and segments TCP port:

	export PORT_BASE=<new TCP port number>

  The cluster will use the PORT_BASE as coordinator port and following
  ports as segment ports.

* Number of segments:

	export NUM_PRIMARY_MIRROR_PAIRS=<number segments>

  It is recommended to specify an odd number of segments, in order
  to catch problems with data distribution. When set to 0, a singlenode
  deployment will be created. Under this mode, there are no segments,
  only one coordinator (QD) and one coordinator standby. All data sit
  on the two nodes and nothing gets distributed.

* Data directory:

	export DATADIRS=<path to directory>

  The data directories for the coordinator and the segments will be
  created under the specified directory path.

* Turn fsync off:

	export BLDWRAP_POSTGRES_CONF_ADDONS="fsync=off"

  A temporary cluster might not need all the ACID data protection,
  therefore fsync can be turned off to speed up the disk I/O.

  Note: NEVER turn off fsync if you intend to run the cluster
        in production!
