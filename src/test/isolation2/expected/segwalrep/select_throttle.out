-- Test: SELECT or other read-only operations which set hint bits on pages,
-- and in turn generate Full Page Images (FPI) WAL records should be throttled.
-- We will only throttle when our transaction wal exceeds
-- wait_for_replication_threshold
-- For this test we will:
-- 1. Set wait_for_replication_threshold to 1kB for quicker test
-- 2. create two tables (one small and one large)
-- 3. set gp_disable_tuple_hints=off so buffer will be immediately marked dirty on hint bit change
-- 4. Suspend walsender
-- 5. Perform a read-only operation (SELECT) which would now set the hint bits
--  For the small table this operation should finish,
--  but for large table the SELECT should be throttled
--  since it would generate a lot of WAL greater than wait_for_replication_threshold
-- 6. Confirm that the query is waiting on Syncrep
-- 7. Reset the walsender and the transaction should complete
--

-- set wait_for_replication_threshold to 1kB for quicker test
